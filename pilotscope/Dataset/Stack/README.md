TODO: Work on logic for the "drift" in the Stack dataset.

According to the paper, it is done on a month by month basis.
For now, the current train/test are for the existing PilotScope workflow, and this needs to be revamped to support benchmarking drift workloads.
Will think about a nice approach later.

The stack queries are from https://rmarcus.info/so_queries.tar.zst

The stack_train.txt is from so/q1/
The stack_test.txt is from so/q2/

I copied each of them one by one
